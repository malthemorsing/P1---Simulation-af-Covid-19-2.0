\section{Scope of Simulation} \label{sec: Scope Simulation}
Within the scope of our simulation, we have chosen to focus on a smaller, geographical area. We initially set the population to be the greater Aalborg area, which has a population of 217,094 people \citep{sundhedsstyrelsen_by_2020} as of 2020. Because of the fairly large population size, special attention was paid to computational efficiency (see section \ref{sec: limitations and challenges}).

Since there are limitations to simulating in C, it was decided to have a smaller population size. Therefore, the final scope of the simulation is the centre of Aalborg, which has a population of 12,366 people as of 2020 \citep{sundhedsstyrelsen_by_2020}. By having a scope with a generally homogeneous population density, the simulation itself likewise becomes quite homogeneous.
