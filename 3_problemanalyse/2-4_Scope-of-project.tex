\section{Scope of Project} \label{sec: Scope project}

The scope of the project encompasses usability of results and reasoning behind making the project in the first place. For this particular project, the reason behind it is to further the study of a topical illness, namely COVID-19. Therefore, the reason for this project's existence is simply to create an effective way of simulating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and what effect contact tracing has on it.

Of course, the source code was created with an explicit intent to input situationally specific variables and parameters of \textit{any} pandemic. This intent heightened the usability of the source code itself, although the results and analyses attached to it are only usable within the scope of the simulation (see section \ref{sec: Scope Simulation}).
